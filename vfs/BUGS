This file documents known bugs in the given release.

Version 1.5.7-pre1
-------------

- mmap may not be consistent across multiple client nodes

- "cp -pr" does not preserve creation time for directories (tar
  may not either).  We need the capfs mgr to handle utime requests
  for files correctly to do this right.

- The kernel "highmem" option is incompatible with our "mapped" transfer
  mechanism.  Please do not use the mapped transfer mechanisms on
  systems that use this option and actually have > 2G of memory.

- O_EXCL is not reliable across seperate clients.
